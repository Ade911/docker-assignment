### Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-simple-html .
   ```

2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-simple-html
   ```

3. Step to Map on Another Port (e.g., Port 5000)
Run the container with a different port, like 5000:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 5000:80 my-simple-html

5000:80: This means that port 5000 on your host machine will map to port 80 inside the container (which is the default port NGINX serves the web page on).
Now you can visit http://localhost:5000 to see your website!
